- 👋 Hi, I’m Sam (she/her)
- 👀 I'm interested in coding, being a mother, learning, exploring the world ...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Git, Github, and all things programming!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything I can get started with! I am still fairly new to this.
- 👩🏻‍💻 Check out some of my pinned repositories to see the projects that best represent my most current work.
