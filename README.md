- 👋 Hi, I’m Sam! (she/her)
- 👀 I'm interested in coding, being a mother to my two year old daughter, learning, exploring the world ...
- 🌱 I hava a good understanding of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JS, and currently learning about APIs, Node.js, and Express. React is also next on my list.
- 🤓 I’m currently learning web dev (front and then hopefully full stack) full time: part-time at a bootcamp (NuCamp) and part-time self-study.
- 👩🏻‍💻 Check out some of my pinned repositories to see the projects that best represent my most current work!
